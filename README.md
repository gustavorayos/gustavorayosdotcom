# Gustavo Rayos Portfolio Website

Portfolio website for Gustavo Rayos used to showcase his skills as a Web Developer and Web Designer. Project was written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and 
is being hosted, with cleaver coding, using Blogger.com servers for free. 

## Getting Started

1) Download folder to local machine.
2) Edit modules as you please.

### Prerequisites

Must have browser to view HTML files. Must have editor to edit files. 

### Installing

Download folder to local directory on system. Double click on HTML files (except for blogger html), and website will open in a brownser with full 
CSS and JavaScript.

## Running the tests

Test was ran using built in Google Chrome Developer tools. Switching resolutions and screen sizes on Google Chrome. Also used various browsers to test 
functionality on multiple web browsers. 

### Break down into end to end tests

These tests were conducted to test the usability and formatting of the code on older architecture and well as newer devices. 

An example of this would be the small screens used in iPhone 5's and older. We need to test that the website works on those devices. 

## Deployment

If you are going to use this code to host on blogger servers, you will have to create empty pages in Blogger by going to the Pages section in Blogger and 
selecting "New Page". This will create a blank HTML file on the server which we will use to trick Blogger into thinking that is is running the HTML code for that page, but it wont. 
In the blogger.html file I have provided, you will need to edit the file to include the URLs of the pages you include and edit the HTML in the if statement 
to run your code on Blogger.
